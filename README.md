## Author üòâ
- My name is Walter Alarc√≥n Garc√©s, a Chilean programmer and poet who has a great passion for computers and technology. Since I was very young, I was interested in the digital world and its possibilities to create, communicate and transform. I studied civil engineering for a while at the University of Chile and specialized in web and mobile application development through some bootcamps. I have also recorded several books of poetry, where I explore themes such as identity, love, nature and society. I consider myself a curious person, creative and committed to my work and ideals. I like to learn new things, share my knowledge and collaborate with other professionals in the technological and literary fields.
