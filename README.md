## 🚀 About me
As a full stack javascript developer, I have experience in building web applications using various frameworks and technologies. I can work with both front-end and back-end aspects of web development, such as designing user interfaces, implementing business logic, and managing databases. I also have some knowledge of python and scratch, which I use for scripting and educational purposes.

## Other Common Github Profile Sections
👩‍💻 I am working on developing a website to administrate a small shop. The website will allow the shop owner to manage inventory, orders, payments and deliveries. The website will also provide a user-friendly interface for customers to browse products, place orders and track their shipments. The website will be built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end, and PHP and MySQL for the back-end. The website will be responsive and compatible with different devices and browsers. The website will follow the best practices of web design and security.

🧠 I'm currently learning ruby on rails, as well as python and scratch. These are three different programming languages that have different applications and features. Ruby on rails is a web development framework that allows me to create dynamic websites and web applications. Python is a general-purpose language that can be used for data analysis, machine learning, web scraping and more. Scratch is a visual programming language that is designed for beginners and children to create interactive stories, games and animations. I enjoy learning new skills and challenging myself with different projects.

⚡️ Besides being a developer, I have a passion for creative writing and scientific exploration. I enjoy composing poems that express my thoughts and feelings in a poetic way. I also like to study maths and physics, as they help me understand the logic and beauty of the natural world. Writing and learning are two of my favorite hobbies that enrich my life and challenge my mind.
